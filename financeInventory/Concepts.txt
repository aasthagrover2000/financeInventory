This is a basic Finance Inventory Project I created to keep track of my investments.

There are four major operations (CRUD) that are implemented.


SERVICE LAYER (Services):
IFinanceService: This is an interface defining CRUD operations and a "FinanceInventoryAsync" method returning ALL entries in MongoDB.
FinanceService: This is a Service implementing the IFinanceService methods:
1. FinanceInventoryAsync: _ => true indicates parameters (in this case, filters) are irrelevant, return ALL items.
2. 


MODELS
FinanceInventoryDatabaseSettings: A Settings class defining 3 variables of ConnectionString, Database name and Collection Name.
FinanceInventory: A class defining the construct of the Finance Data stored in MongoDB. "Id" represents the key value that will be used as unique key.

CONTROLLER:
FinanceInventoryController: In this controller, we are defining 5 HTTP Methods:
1. Get() : calls the IFinanceService -> FinanceService method: FinanceInventoryAsync and waits for response.
2. Get(byID): 
:Length(24) Signifies the 24 HEX digit mandated by thr ObjectId created by Mongo.
